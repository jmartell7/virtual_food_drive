# Foodbank Shopper
This software is intended to act as a shopping portal to help raise donations for foodbanks. 
Visitors shop for food items and checkout via a link to a separate donation portal with the amount prefilled.
This is a single page application that you can easily edit and deploy for your Foodbank's use.
  
This application does not process payment. It will link into your payment processing system.

## Using this template

1. Update the checkout url. Find `checkoutUrl` in the script.js file and update the path to your payment processing platform.
2. Edit the catalog of items. Find `catalog_data` in the script.js file and change the values based on your foodbank inventory.
3. Replace FOODBANK NAME in index.html with your foodbank name. Remove the 501c3 line from index.html if needed.
4. Replace the foodbank links with your website url.
5. Edit the images for your needs.
